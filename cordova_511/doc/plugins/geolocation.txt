cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation

This plugin provides information about the device's location, such as latitude and longitude.
Common sources of location information include Global Positioning System (GPS) and location 
inferred from network signals such as IP address, RFID, WiFi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, 
and GSM/CDMA cell IDs. There is no guarantee that the API returns the device's actual location.

Android下只需要添加权限即可，不需要任何代码支持，原因是：
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5977
Android plugin support has been removed. Yi Ming Kuan said: "The reason we went with CB-5977 is that
the webview on newer Android versions will get GPS locks more quickly than the native API, hence its
removal. Adding the plugin on Android just adds the necessary permissions to use HTML5 Geolocation in your app."
